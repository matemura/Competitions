[If not, it is an interseting and easy programmingexercise to represent integers of any length as an array of single digits together withfunctions that manipluate them to performaddition, subtraction and multiplication using the rules that we all learned at school.]We have the basic recursive definition, of course (where <i>recursive</i> just means that we are defining one value of F in terms of two other, simpler, values of F):<div class=indentrule>                   F(0)=0<br>                   F(1)=1<br>                   F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), n&gt;1</div>      but the disadvantage is that to calculate F(1000), for example,      we need to compute all 999 numbers before it.  <br>      Alternatively, using Binet's formula above means we need to       compute many decimal places of &radic;5.      <br>      So the question we have is:      <div class=question> Can we find a quicker method using only integers?      </div>One method was proposed by the late <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/">Prof. Edsgar W Dijkstra</a> around 1978,described in <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd06xx/EWD654.PDF">note EWD654 "In honor of Fibonacci"</a> (PDF, 38K; download the free <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html">Acrobat Reader</a> to view it if your browser will not display it).<br>Note that Dijkstra's series begins F(1)=0 and F(2)=1 so, using our index systemwhich has F(0)=0 and F(1)=1, we have:<div class=indentrule>   F(2n-1) = F(n-1)<sup>2</sup> + F(n)<sup>2</sup><br>   F(2n) = ( 2 F(n-1) + F(n) ) F(n)</div>which need only F(n) and F(n-1) to compute both F(2n) and F(2n-1).Although the formula in Dijkstra's notewere "well-known" in 1978, his method of using these two formula in this way asan efficient algorithm for computing big Fibonacci numbers may be original.<br>So, to compute F(1000) we would use the two formulae as follows:<ul><li>F(1000) needs F(500) and F(499)</li><li>F(500) and <br>F(499) need  F(250) and F(249)</li><li>F(250) and <br>F(249) need F(124) and F(125)</li><li>F(124) needs F(61) and F(62)</li><li>F(125) needs F(62) and F(63)</li><li>F(63)  needs F(32) and F(31)</li><li>F(62) and <br>F(61) needs F(31) and F(30)</li><li>F(32) and <br>F(31) need F(16) and F(15)</li><li>F(30) needs F(15) and F(14)</li><li>F(16) and <br>F(15) need F(8) and F(7)</li><li>F(14) needs F(7) and F(6)</li><li>F(8) and <br>F(7) need F(4) and F(3)</li><li>F(6) needs F(3) and F(2)</li><li>F(4) and <br>F(3) need F(2) and F(1)</li><li>F(2) needs F(1) and F(0)</li><li>F(1) and <br>F(0) are 1 and 0 by definition </li></ul>  So there are very few (22) F values needed to compute F(1000) and it takes  <i>much less work</i> than using the method of "add the previous two F values to get the next one".    <p>  See also <a href="fibrab.html#fibnbs">Computers use the Rabbit Sequence</a>  on the <a href="fibrab.html">Golden String</a> page at this site for another insight  into computers and computing Fibonacci numbers. <!--FIBHR--><P align=center class=nbHR>0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987 ..<a href="fibtable.html">More</a>.. <a href="fibCalcX.html"><img src="calcicon.gif" border=0 vspace=0 hspace=0 align=middle width=34 height=13 alt="Calculator"></a></p>  <h2>   <a name="calcnext">         Calculating the next Fibonacci number directly  </a>  </h2>      Suppose we have evaluated Fib(100) and we want to know the   next value: Fib(101).

This is where Binet's formula comes in since it will give uscomplex numbers as n  varies over the real numbers.<p> So what happens if we plot a graph of F(n) described by Binet's formula,plotting the results on an Argand diagram?<p><span style="color:#0000FF">The blue plotis for positive values of n from 0 to 6.</span>  Note how this curve crosses thex axis (representing the "real part of the complex number") at the Fibonacci numbers, 0, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8. But there is a loop so it crosses the axis <i>twice</i> at x=1, andwe really do get the whole Fibonacci sequence 0,1,1,2,3,5,8.. as the crossing points.<br><span style="color:#FF0000">The red plot is of negative values of n from -6 to 0.</span>  It also crosses thex axis at the values -8, 5, -3, 2, -1, 1 and 0 corresponding to the Fibonacci numbersF(-6), F(-5), F(-4), F(-3), F(-2), F(-1) and F(0).<br><img src="fibnegARGAND.gif" width=270 height=190 alt="fib neg"><img src="fibposARGAND.gif" width=286 height=189 alt="fib pos"><br> Spirals?<ul><li> Note that the red spiral for negative values of n  is NOT an equiangular or logarithmic spiral that we found in  <a href="fibnat.html#spiral">sea-shells on the Fibonacci in Nature</a> page.  This is because  the curve crosses the x axis at 1 and next at 2,   so the distance from the origin has doubled,   but the next crossing is not at 4 (which would mean another doubling as required for  a logarithmic spiral) but at 5.<li> If you adjust the width of your browser window, you should be able  to see both curves side by side.  Now it looks as if the two curves are made from the same 3-dimensional  spiral spring-shape,  a bit like the spiral bed-springs in cartoons,   getting narrower towards one end.   The red curve seems to be looking down the centre  of the three-dimensional spring and the blue one looking at the same spring shape  but from the side.      Comparing the two diagrams  we can see that even the heights of the loops are the same!<br>  I haven't yet found an explanation for this - can you find one?
