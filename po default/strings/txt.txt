im going wild couldnt compile
gave all the best that i got
ran out of bytes at least i tried
to faster climb up to the top
theres even more go multicore
black is the code for tonight
time to oppose feel no remorse
find out whose source isnt right
top coder
dare i to challenge or dare i to fold
no sense at all in this deadly black code
pressin the button sanity screams
twenty five down how tf can this be

think hard and find
solutions to problems withstand
freak out and type for us
submit your source
live until the test phase is
over
