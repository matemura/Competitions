The generator produces instances of the minimum-cost circulation
problem in the DIMACS format. The graphs are based on grids embedded
on the torus. Each node is connected to nodes in X and Y directions,
up to a specified distance (that determines graph density).
The expected capacities of "longer" (with respect to the mesh) arcs
are smaller then those of the shorter arcs. The costs are random.

To use the generator, compile, run, and answer a few questions it
asks.
