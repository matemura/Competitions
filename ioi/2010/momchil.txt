Momchil,

I have created you an account on our beta grading
server.  You'll be able to see all the task names --
please just ignore the ones that don't apply

To access the grading server,

  https://cforall.uwaterloo.ca:8443

  momchil:       8bf15629

To access the competition tasks,

  https://plg1.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~gvcormac/bbb/day1
  https://plg1.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~gvcormac/bbb/day2

  bbb:    bbbISit

Please make sure you install version 1.3 of RunC:

  http://plg1.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~gvcormac/RunC-IOI/

(If you have version 1.2, just install this over top.)

I would appreciate it if, as far as possible, you
could do the two days as you would two separate competition
days, and give me feedback on what you did, what you found
confusing, etc. 

thanks and regards,

Gordon
