                           SILVER PROBLEMS

                  Three problems numbered 6 through 8
**********************************************************************

Problem 6: Mooo [Brian Dean, 2005]

Farmer John's N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 50,000) cows are standing in a very
straight row and mooing. Each cow has a unique height h in the range
1..2,000,000,000 nanometers (FJ really is a stickler for precision).
Each cow moos at some volume v in the range 1..10,000. This "moo"
travels across the row of cows in both directions (except for the
end cows, obviously). Curiously, it is heard only by the closest
cow in each direction whose height is strictly larger than that of
the mooing cow (so each moo will be heard by 0, 1 or 2 other cows,
depending on not whether or taller cows exist to the mooing cow's
right or left).

The total moo volume heard by given cow is the sum of all the moo
volumes v for all cows whose mooing reaches the cow. Since some
(presumably taller) cows might be subjected to a very large moo
volume, FJ wants to buy earmuffs for the cow whose hearing is most
threatened. Please compute the loudest moo volume heard by any cow.

PROBLEM NAME: moooo

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer, N.

* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 contains two space-separated integers, h and
        v, for the cow standing at location i.

SAMPLE INPUT (file moooo.in):

3
4 2
3 5
6 10

INPUT DETAILS:

Three cows: the first one has height 4 and moos with volume 2, etc.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The loudest moo volume heard by any single cow.

SAMPLE OUTPUT (file moooo.out):

7

OUTPUT DETAILS:

The third cow hears both the first and second cows moo 2+5=7.  Though the
third cow moos with volume 10, no one hears her.

Problem 7: Water Slides [Eric Price, 2006]

It's a hot summer day, and Farmer John is letting Betsy go to the
water park where she intends to ride every single slide. The water
park has N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 10,000) platforms (numbered 1..N) from which
to enter the M (1 &lt;= M &lt;= 10,000) water slides. Each water slide
starts at the top of some platform and ends at the bottom of some
platform (possibly the same one). Some platforms might have more
than one slide; some might not have any.

The park is very thin, so the platforms lie along a straight line,
each platform at a position Xi (0 &lt;= Xi &lt;= 100,000) meters from one
end of the park. One walks from one platform to the next via a
sidewalk parallel to the line of platforms.

The platforms of the water park are weakly connected; that is, the
park cannot be divided into two sets of platforms with no slides
running between the two sets. Both the entrance and exit to the
park are at platform 1, so Betsy will start and end there.

In order to spend more time on the slides, Betsy wants to walk as
little as possible. Find the minimum distance Betsy must travel
along the ground in order to try every slide in the park exactly
once without repeating.

PROBLEM NAME: slides

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two integers, N and M.

* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 contains one integer, Xi, the position of
        platform i.

* Lines N+2..M+N+1: Line i+N+1 contains two integers, Si and Di,
        respectively the start and end platforms of a slide.

SAMPLE INPUT (file slides.in):

5 7
5
3
1
7
10
1 2
1 2
2 3
3 1
4 5
1 5
4 1

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: One integer, the minimum number of meters Betsy must walk.

SAMPLE OUTPUT (file slides.out):

8

OUTPUT DETAILS:

Betsy slides from 1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 1 -&gt; 2, then walks a distance 2
back to platform 1. She can then slide to 5, walk to 4, slide to
5, walk back to 4 and slide to 1 for a total distance of 8.

Problem 8: Lights Out [Rob Kolstad, 2005]

The cows so much prefer to sleep in the dark. Every night, though,
when they return to the barn, some of the L (3 &lt;= L &lt;= 50) lights
are switched on. They know the location of the push button switches
but, as is always the problem, they lack fingers. The buttons are
arranged in a nice row, and the left most button (#1) toggles light
#1; the next button to the right toggles light #2; and so on.
('Toggle' means change from off-to-on or on-to-off, depending on
the current state of the switch.)

They do however have an unusual pitchfork with T (1 &lt;= T &lt;= 7)
slots, each one of which might hold a tine that can push the switches.
Some tines are present; some might be absent. By way of example,
imagine a pitchfork with T=4 and a missing tine. This particular
pitchfork has tines in the 1st, 2nd, and 4th positions, easily
described as '1101'.

If the pitchfork is aimed at the leftmost switch, then lights #1,
#2, and #4 are toggled (#3 isn't toggled since there is no tine
there). If the pitchfork is aimed at switch #3, then lights #3, #4,
and #6 are toggled. The pitchfork must be aimed so that all its
tine slots touch switches; the fork cannot cross the end of the line of
switches.

Given a list of lights that are on and a configuration for a
pitchfork, determine a sequence of pitchfork presses that will
toggle the lights until the minimum number of lights is lit.

PROBLEM NAME: xlite

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: L and T

* Line 2: A line with L characters (and no spaces), each of which is
        '0' or '1'. '1' means a light in that slot is lit; '0' means
        the light in that slot is not lit.

* Line 3: A line with T characters, each of which is '0' or '1' (no
        spaces are present). '1' means a tine is present on the
        pitchfork in that slot; '0' means otherwise.  The pitchfork
        can not be inverted.

SAMPLE INPUT (file xlite.in):

10 4
1111111111
1101

INPUT DETAILS:

All 10 lights all on; three of four tines are present on the pitchfork
(tine #3 is missing)

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: K, the number of positions at which the pitchfork was aimed.

* Lines 2..K+1: Each line contains a single integer X (1 &lt;= X &lt;=
        L-T+1) that tells where the pitchfork was aimed (the leftmost
        tine slot, that is) to toggle some lights. A program will
        evaluate the decisions to simulate toggling the lights.  Full
        credit is given for minimal-length solutions that leave to the
        minimum number of lights turned on; partial credit for
        solutions that take longer to minimize the lights. It is not
        always possible switch all the lights off.

SAMPLE OUTPUT (file xlite.out):

5
3
1
4
7
6

OUTPUT DETAILS:

1111111111  Start
1100101111  Toggle 3
0001101111  Toggle 1
0000000111  Toggle 4
0000001010  Toggle 7
0000010000  Toggle 6
One light remaining is the best one can do.  Many other solutions
will leave one light lit (possibly a different light).
