<h1>Task: Hollows</h1><hr><p> <!-- w zasadzie: hollow scooped out in a tree trunk - krotszej nazwy chyba nie ma! -->
	There are two extremely high trees in Byteotia, and each of them has many hollows scooped out in its trunk,
	one under another.
    Once upon a time <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span> very fast birds decided to inhabit the hollows.
    Some of them know each other and therefore would like to be able to pay one another visits in their hollows.
    The birds fly very fast and always along a straight line.
    In order to avoid the danger of collision <!-- clash? crash? --> they decided to quarter in a way that:

</p><ul>
<li>each two birds that would like to pay themselves visits live in different trees, and
</li>
<li>for each two pairs of familiar birds, the segments connecting the hollows of the familiar birds
do not intersect (they may, however, have a common endpoint).

</li>
</ul>
    In addition, the birds would like to live as low as possible.
    So in each tree they inhabit a certain number of lower hollows.
    There are more hollows in each tree than there are birds in whole.

<p>
It is well-known that birds have very small brains.
    That's why they have asked you -- a respected ornithologist -- to help them find out in how many
    ways they can quarter in the hollows.

</p><p>

</p><h1>Task</h1>
      Write a programme that:

<ul>
<li>reads from the standard input the description of acquaintanceship between the birds,
</li>
<li>calculates in how many ways can the birds be quartered in the trees, satisfying the above constraints,
</li>
<li>writes the result to the standard output.

</li>
</ul>

<p>

</p><h1>Input</h1>
      In the first line of the standard input there are three integers written
      <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span>, <span class="MATH"><i>m</i></span> and <span class="MATH"><i>k</i></span>, denoting respectively:
      the number of birds, the number of distinct pairs of birds knowing each other
      and the number that is to be used when giving result
      (see: Output),
      <!-- MATH
 $2 \le n \le 1\,000\,000$
 -->
<span class="MATH">2<i> &lt;= n &lt;= </i>1&nbsp;000&nbsp;000</span>,
      <!-- MATH
 $1 \le m \le 10\,000\,000$
 -->
<span class="MATH">1<i> &lt;= m &lt;= </i>10&nbsp;000&nbsp;000</span>,
      <!-- MATH
 $2 \le k \le 2\,000\,000$
 -->
<span class="MATH">2<i> &lt;= k &lt;= </i>2&nbsp;000&nbsp;000</span>.
      The birds are numbered from 1 to <span class="MATH"><i>n</i></span>.
      In the following <span class="MATH"><i>m</i></span> lines the pairs of birds knowing each other are given,
      one per line.
      In the line no. <span class="MATH"><i>i</i> + 1</span> two integers <span class="MATH"><i>a</i><sub>i</sub></span> and <span class="MATH"><i>b</i><sub>i</sub></span>,
      separated by a single space, are written
      <!-- MATH
 $1 \le a_i, b_i \le n$
 -->
<span class="MATH">(1<i> &lt;= a</i><sub>i</sub>, <i>b</i><sub>i</sub> &lt;= <i>n</i></span>, <!-- MATH
 $\;a_i \neq b_i$
 -->
<span class="MATH">&nbsp;<i>a</i><sub>i</sub> &lt;&gt; <i>b</i><sub>i</sub>)</span>.
      These are the numbers of the familiar birds.
      Each (unordered) pair of familiar birds is given exactly once.

<p>

</p><h1>Output</h1>
      Let <span class="MATH"><i>r</i></span> denote the number of distinct quarterings of birds satysfying the given constraints.
      Your programme should write one integer in the first line of the standard output:
      the remainder of division of <span class="MATH"><i>r</i></span> by <span class="MATH"><i>k</i></span>.
      If no quartering exists the correst result is 0.
