                           GOLD PROBLEMS
**********************************************************************
                  Three problems numbered 1 through 3
**********************************************************************

Problem 1: Maximum Milk (2) [Brian Dean, 2010]

Farmer John has a list of N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 250,000) cows conveniently
numbered 1..N that he can purchase. Each cow j has a specific milk
output M_j (1 &lt;= M_j &lt;= 1,000,000,000) as well as the two specific
feed types F1_j and F2_j (1 &lt;= F1_j &lt;= 2*N; 1 &lt;= F2_j &lt;= 2*N; F1_j
!= F2_j) she requires for dinner. She must eat one unit of either
feed type every day.

FJ wants to purchase a set of cows whose total milk output is as
large as possible. However, he must be able to feed all the cows
he purchases, and he can only supply one unit per day of each feed
type. So, for each cow he purchases, he must assign one of the two
feasible feed types it will eat so that at most one cow in the herd
feeds on each specific feed type.

Help Farmer John maximize his milk output. Write a program that
reads in the milk output and feed types for each cow and supplies
the maximum possible milk output.

PROBLEM NAME: maxmilk2

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer: N

* Lines 2..N+1: Line j+1 describes cow j with three space-separated
        integers: M_j, F1_j, and F2_j

SAMPLE INPUT (file maxmilk2.in):

5
2 7 2
8 2 8
2 5 2
2 5 8
6 7 5

INPUT DETAILS:

There are five cows. Cows 1, 2, and 3 will eat feed type 2. Cows 3, 4, and
5 will eat feed type 5. Cows 1 and 5 will eat feed type 7, and cows 2 and 4
will eat feed type 8.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer: Farmer John's maximum possible milk
        output.

SAMPLE OUTPUT (file maxmilk2.out):

18

OUTPUT DETAILS:

We can feed cows 1, 2, 3, and 5 by giving cow 1 feed type 2, cow 2
feed type 8, cow 3 feed type 5, and cow 5 feed type 7. This yields
a total milk output of 18, which is the best possible.

**********************************************************************

Problem 2: Tornado [Brian Dean, 2004]

Farmer John lives on a farm with N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 1,000) fields
conveniently numbered 1..N. On a particularly terrifying day, a
tornado hit Farmer John's farm and destroyed some of the directed
trails between pairs of fields. For example, where there might have
been a directed trail connecting from field 1 to field 3, there
might no longer be such a trail. The remaining set of M directed
trails (1 &lt;= M &lt;= 10,000) unfortunately might not be sufficient to
allow Farmer John to travel between all pairs of fields along a
sequence of directed trails.

Help Farmer John determine the minimum number of directed trails
he must build in order to restore full "connectivity" to his farm,
so that he can successfully travel between any pair of fields along
some sequence of directed trails.

Directed trails are described by their endpoints E_1i and E_2i (1
&lt;= E_1i &lt;= N; 1 &lt;= E_2i &lt;= N; E_1i != E_2i). Note that directed
trail (i,j) goes the opposite direction from trail (j,i), even
though both connect the same fields. The existence of trail (i,j)
is independent of trail (j,i): one of the pair might exist, both
might exist, or none might exist.

PROBLEM NAME: tornado2

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and M

* Lines 2..M+1: Line i+1 describes an extant directed trail i with two
        space-separated integers: E_1i and E_2i.

SAMPLE INPUT (file tornado2.in):

4 6
1 2
3 1
1 3
1 4
3 4
4 1

INPUT DETAILS:

Below is a map of the farm's trails:

   2 &lt;--- 1 &lt;--&gt; 4
          ^      ^
          |      |
          v     / 
          3 ----

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer that is the maximum number of trails FJ can
        build to re-establish connectivity

SAMPLE OUTPUT (file tornado2.out):

1

OUTPUT DETAILS:

A single additional directed trail from 2 to any of the three other fields
will suffice to restore connectivity.

Problem 3: Milk Team Select [Percy Liang, 2002]

Farmer John's N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 500) cows are trying to select the
milking team for the world-famous Multistate Milking Match-up (MMM)
competition. As you probably know, any team that produces at least
X (1 &lt;= X &lt;= 1,000,000) gallons of milk is a winner.

Each cow has the potential of contributing between -10,000 and
10,000 gallons of milk. (Sadly, some cows have a tendency to knock
over jugs containing milk produced by other cows.)

The MMM prides itself on promoting family values. FJ's cows have
no doubt that they can produce X gallons of milk and win the contest,
but to support the contest's spirit, they want to send a team with
as many parent-child relationships as possible (while still producing
at least X gallons of milk). Not surprisingly, all the cows on FJ's
farm are female.

Given the family tree of FJ's cows and the amount of milk that each
would contribute, compute the maximum number of parent-child
relationships that can exist in a winning team. Note that a set of
cows with a grandmother-mother-daughter combination has two
parent-child relationships (grandmother-mother, mother-daughter).

PROBLEM NAME: tselect

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers, N and X.

* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 contains two space-separated integers
        describing cow i. The first integer is the number of gallons
        of milk cow i would contribute. The second integer (range
        1..N) is the index of the cow's mother. If the cow's mother is
        unknown, the second number is 0. The family information has no
        cycles: no cow is her own mother, grandmother, etc.

SAMPLE INPUT (file tselect.in):

5 8
-1 0
3 1
5 1
-3 3
2 0

INPUT DETAILS:

There are 5 cows. Cow 1 can produce -1 gallons and has two daughters, cow
2 and 3, who can produce 3 and 5 gallons, respectively. Cow 3 has a
daughter (cow 4) who can produce -3 gallons. Then there's cow 5, who can
produce 2 gallons.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The maximum number of parent-child relationships possible on
        a winning team. Print -1 if no team can win.

SAMPLE OUTPUT (file tselect.out):

2

OUTPUT DETAILS:

The best team consists of cows 1, 2, 3, and 5. Together they produce
(-1)+3+5+2 = 9 &gt;= 8 gallons and have 2 parent-child relationships
(1--2 and 1--3). Note that a team with cows 2, 3, and 5 would be
able to produce more milk (10 gallons), but would have fewer
parent-child relationships (0).
