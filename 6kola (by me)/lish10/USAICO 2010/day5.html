                  Three problems numbered 1 through 3
**********************************************************************

Problem 1: Counting the Cows [Traditional, 2010]

Farmer John wants to simulate his cow herd and their milk output.
He wants the program to be able to do the following:

  (1) add a cow to the simulation with a given milk output
  (2) remove the cow with the lowest milk output

While he is doing this, he wants a running count of the lowest milk
output of any cow in the herd.

You think to yourself that this is quite similar to the heap you
learned about in data structures class. However, there is a catch.
Farmer John also wants to be able to go back to old versions of the
herd, so that he has the chance to perform multiple experiments.

For example, Farmer John could have the following sequence of
instructions (V indicates the instruction number, which is also the
version number):

V   Instruction                      Lowest output    Cows
1.  Add cow with output 5            5                [5]
2.  Add cow with output 2            2                [2,5]
3.  Add cow with output 3            2                [2,3,5]
4.  Remove cow with lowest output    3                [3,5]
5.  Go back to version 2             2                [2,5]
6.  Remove cow with lowest output    5                [5]
7.  Go to version 4                  3                [3,5]
8.  Remove cow with lowest output    5                [5]
9.  Go to version 7                  3                [3,5]
10. Go to version 9                  3                [3,5]
11. Add cow with output 1            1                [1,3,5]

Please help Farmer John by implementing the program described above.
You will be given a sequence of N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 100,000) operations.
After each operation, you should report the current minimum milk
output of any cow in the herd.

NOTE: Your program is not allowed to batch the input. It should
read each query, then write the answer to that query and only
afterwards read the next query.

Instructions are given in one of the following forms (A, D, and G
are literal characters, c and v are integers):

	A c
	D
	G v

* If the line contains 'A c', then you are instructed to add a cow
  with milk output c (1 &lt;= c &lt;= 1,000,000,000).

* If the line contains 'D', then you are instructed to remove the
  cow with the lowest milk output.

* If the line contains 'G v', then you are instructed to load version
  v (it is guaranteed that 1 &lt;= v &lt; i).

Note that loading a version does not go back to the old version,
it creates a copy of the old version that FJ can then manipulate
independently.

It is guaranteed that there will always be at least one cow after
each query.

MEMORY LIMIT: 64 Megabytes

PROBLEM NAME: cowcount

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer: N

* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1: The instruction to be processed and saved as
        version i.

Problem 2: Bovine Justice League [South America 2007 Problem J, 2010]

Few people know the secret world of supercows. A total of N (2 &lt;=
N &lt;= 100,000) supercows (conveniently numbered 1..N) roam the earth
fighting against evil. They have R (1 &lt;= R &lt;= 1,000,000) mutual
friendships among them. Friendship i links cows A_i and B_i (1 &lt;=
A_i &lt;= N; 1 &lt;= B_i &lt;= N; A_i != B_i). Of course, friendship is an
undirected relation.

Many supercows want to form a Bovine Justice League, a (possibly
empty) subset of the N cows that should last as long as it is needed.
A stable Justice League requires that all of the cows in it to be
friends and, additionally, that no pair of non-member cows be friends
with each other -- because they might attempt to form a rival league
of lesser stature. Given the list of cows who are friends with each
other, perform two tasks:
   * determine the number of valid Justice Leagues
   * output at least one valid Justice League membership roster.
Your program will earn half the points on a given test case for
solving either subtask correctly.

It is guaranteed that there exists at least one valid Justice League,
and that the total number of valid Justice Leagues will fit into a
64-bit signed integer.

Consider a set of 5 cows with 5 friendships (friendships denoted
by lines; the 1-4 line crosses the 2-3 line but does not indicate
a four-way friendship):

             ____1____
            /    |    \
           2----/------3 
               /      /
              4      5

For this set, there are two valid justice leagues: Cows 1, 2, and
3 can form the justice league, or cows 1 and 3 can form the justice
league on their own.

Time Limit: 3 seconds

Memory Limit: 32 megabytes

PROBLEM NAME: justice

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and R

* Lines 2..R+1: Line i+1 describes a friendship with two
        space-separated integers: A_i and B_i

SAMPLE INPUT (file justice.in):

5 5
1 2
2 3
1 3
1 4
3 5

OUTPUT FORMAT:

The first line of input should contain a single integer: the number of
potential legal Justice Leagues. If you do not have an answer to this
subtask, you may output any non-negative integer which fits within a
64-bit signed integer.

The remaining lines of input should contain a description of one
valid Justice League. The first of these lines should contain a
single integer S: the number of members in this Justice League. The
next S lines should contain the members of the Justice League in
any order. If you do not have an answer to this subtask, you should output 
0 for S.

SAMPLE OUTPUT (file justice.out):

Problem 3: Tallying the Herd [PA, 2010]

In a fast developing herd like Farmer John's, new cows are often
brought into the mix.  Each new cow P is assigned a direct supervisor,
who might have supervisors herself; all these cows are considered
supervisors of P.

We call the direct supervisor of P a 'supervisor of degree 0'. The
supervisor of a 'supervisor of degree 0' has degree 1. In general,
a supervisor of a supervisor of degree K has degree K+1. In this
way, a cow is a subordinate of her immediate supervisor and also
of supervisors of higher degree. This defines a hierarchy of all
cows, which has the herd's leader, Bessie, at its top.

The history of all cows who have joined the herd since its founding
is recorded. Some cows wonder the number of subordinates for whom
they are supervisors of degree K. Write a program to figure this
out.

The input contains N and then N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 100,000) events, each
of which is either the arrival of a new cow or a query from a current
cow. After the initial value of N, subsequent lines contain event
descriptions, one per line, given in chronological order.

Initially, only the supervisor (Bessie) is in the herd; she has ID
number 1. N events of the form 'Z int int' or 'P int int' are given;
they expand the herd.

* A 'Z' event represents the arrival of a new cow. The two integers
  are P_i (2 &lt;= P_i &lt;= 100,000; P_i != P_j for i != j) and S_i,
  which respectively represent the ID numbers of the new cow and
  her assigned immediate superior. S_i is guaranteed to equal the
  ID number of a current herd member.

* A 'P' event represents a question from a cow Q_i about the number
  of her subordinates for whom she is a supervisor of exactly degree
  K_i. The two integers are Q_i and K_i (1 &lt;= Q_i &lt;= 100,000; 0 &lt;=
  K_i &lt;= 100,000).

For 5 out of the 9 cases in the initial test data, all 'Z' lines
come before all 'P' lines. Note that your code must pass the sample
input to be accepted by the grader, so you will have to do something
to make sure this happens (e.g., by hard-coding in the answer).

Memory Limit: 32 megabytes

PROBLEM NAME: therd

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer: N

* Lines 2..N+1: Each line contains one event, as above

SAMPLE INPUT (file therd.in):

8
Z 2 1
P 1 0
Z 3 1
Z 4 2
P 1 1
P 1 0
Z 5 2
P 2 0

OUTPUT FORMAT:

For each line starting with 'P', the answer to the corresponding
query.

SAMPLE OUTPUT (file therd.out):

1
1
2
2
