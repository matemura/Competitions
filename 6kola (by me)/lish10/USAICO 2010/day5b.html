                           GOLD PROBLEMS
**********************************************************************
                  Three problems numbered 1 through 3
**********************************************************************

Problem 1: Space Elevator [Coaches , 2004]

The cows are going to space! They plan to achieve orbit by building
a sort of space elevator: a giant tower of blocks. They have K (1
&lt;= K &lt;= 150) different types of blocks with which to build the
tower. Blocks of type i has height h_i (1 &lt;= h_i &lt;= 100) and are
available in quantity c_i (1 &lt;= c_i &lt;= 5000). Due to possible damage
caused by cosmic rays, no part of a block of type i can exceed a
maximum altitude a_i (1 &lt;= a_i &lt;= 100000).

Help the cows build the tallest space elevator possible by stacking
blocks on top of each other according to the rules. Also count the
number of different ways the cows can make a space elevator of
maximum height. This number can be very large, so compute it modulo
1000000007.

PROBLEM NAME: elevator2

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer: K

* Lines 2..K+1: Line i+1 describes block type i with three
        space-separated integers: h_i, a_i, and c_i

SAMPLE INPUT (file elevator2.in):

3
7 40 3
5 23 8
2 52 6

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers, H, the maximum height of a
        tower that can be built, and N, the number of ways this height
        can be achieved modulo 1000000007.

SAMPLE OUTPUT (file elevator2.out):

48 1

OUTPUT DETAILS:

From the bottom: 3 blocks of type 2, below 3 of type 1, below 6 of
type 3.  Stacking 4 blocks of type 2 and 3 of type 1 is not legal,
since the top of the last type 1 block would exceed height 40.
This height can only be made one way.

**********************************************************************

Problem 2: Fence Obstacle Course [USACO coaches, 2004]

Farmer John has constructed an obstacle course for the cows'
exercising enjoyment. The course comprises a sequence of N fences
(1 &lt;= N &lt;= 50,000) of varying lengths, each parallel to the x axis.
Fence i's y coordinate is i.

The door to FJ's barn (which is the cows' ultimate destination) is
at the origin (marked '*' in the diagram below). The starting point
of the course lies at coordinate (S,N).

     S
   +-+-+-+-+        (fence #N)

 +-+-+-+            (fence #N-1)

     ...               ...

   +-+-+-+          (fence #2)

     +-+-+-+        (fence #1)

=|=|=|=*=|=|=|      (barn)
-3-2-1 0 1 2 3    

Bessie is positioned just slightly above/north of fence #N.

FJ's original intention was for the cows to jump over the fences,
but cows are much more comfortable keeping all four hooves on the
ground. Thus, they will walk along the fence and, when the fence
ends, they will turn towards the x axis and continue walking in a
straight line until they hit another fence segment or the side of
the barn. They then decide to go left or right until they reach the
end of the fence segment, and so on, until they finally reach the
side of the barn and then, potentially after a short walk, the
ending point.

Two integers describe fence i: A_i and B_i (-100,000 &lt;= A_i &lt; B_i;
A_i &lt; B_i &lt;= 100,000) that are respectively the starting and ending
x-coordinates. Note that the fences will be traversed in reverse
order of the input sequence.

Starting position S lies on fence N such that A_N &lt;= S &lt;= B_N.

Naturally, the cows want to walk as little as possible. Find the
minimum distance the cows have to travel back and forth to get from
the starting point to the door of the barn.

PROBLEM NAME: obstacle

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and S

* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 describes fence i with two space-separated
        integers: A_i and B_i

SAMPLE INPUT (file obstacle.in):

4 0
-2 1
-1 2
-3 0
-2 1

INPUT DETAILS:

Four segments like this:

       S
   +-+-+-+             Fence 4

 +-+-+-+               Fence 3

     +-+-+-+           Fence 2

   +-+-+-+             Fence 1

 |=|=|=*=|=|=|         Barn
-3-2-1 0 1 2 3      

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The minimum distance back and forth in the x direction
        required to get from the starting point to the ending point by
        walking around the fences. The distance in the y direction is
        not counted.

SAMPLE OUTPUT (file obstacle.out):

4

OUTPUT DETAILS:

Walk one unit in the positive direction (to 1,4), then head toward
the barn, trivially going around fence 3. Walk in the positive
direction one more unit (to 2,2), then walk to the side of the barn.
Walk two more units toward the origin for a total of 4 units of
back-and-forth walking.

Problem 3: Tallying the Herd (2) [PA, 2010]

In a fast developing herd like Farmer John's, new cows are often
brought into the mix.  Each new cow P is assigned a direct supervisor,
who might have supervisors herself; all these cows are considered
supervisors of P.

We call the direct supervisor of P a 'supervisor of degree 0'. The
supervisor of a 'supervisor of degree 0' has degree 1. In general,
a supervisor of a supervisor of degree K has degree K+1. In this
way, a cow is a subordinate of her immediate supervisor and also
of supervisors of higher degree. This defines a hierarchy of all
cows, which has the herd's leader, Bessie, at its top.

The history of all cows who have joined the herd since its founding
is recorded. Some cows wonder the number of subordinates for whom
they are supervisors of degree K. Write a program to figure this
out.

The input contains N and then N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 100,000) events, each
of which is either the arrival of a new cow or a query from a current
cow. After the initial value of N, subsequent lines contain event
descriptions, one per line, given in chronological order.

Initially, only the supervisor (Bessie) is in the herd; she has ID
number 1. N events of the form 'Z int int' or 'P int int' are given;
they expand the herd.

* A 'Z' event represents the arrival of a new cow. The two integers
  are P_i (2 &lt;= P_i &lt;= 100,000; P_i != P_j for i != j) and S_i,
  which respectively represent the ID numbers of the new cow and
  her assigned immediate superior. S_i is guaranteed to equal the
  ID number of a current herd member.

* A 'P' event represents a question from a cow Q_i about the number
  of her subordinates for whom she is a supervisor of exactly degree
  K_i. The two integers are Q_i and K_i (1 &lt;= Q_i &lt;= 100,000; 0 &lt;=
  K_i &lt;= 100,000).

For this version of the task, all 'Z' lines come before all 'P'
lines.

Memory Limit: 32 megabytes

PROBLEM NAME: therd2

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer: N

* Lines 2..N+1: Each line contains one event, as above

SAMPLE INPUT (file therd2.in):

7
Z 2 1
Z 3 1
Z 4 2
Z 5 2
P 1 0
P 1 1
P 2 0

OUTPUT FORMAT:

For each line starting with 'P', the answer to the corresponding
query.

SAMPLE OUTPUT (file therd2.out):

2
2
2
