                           GOLD PROBLEMS
**********************************************************************
                  Three problems numbered 1 through 3
**********************************************************************

Problem 1: The Cherry Tree [PA, 2010]

O those cows like their cherries. Farmer John treated the cows to
a special cherry tree he planted in the very middle of the pasture.
These cherries are rare fruits and can only be found on branches
from which no other branches grow. Bessie is in charge of harvesting
and wonders how many cuts need to be performed for all the cherries
to be collected.

The cherry tree is a trunk (which is, for our purposes, a branch)
with branches growing from the trunk. Branches contain either other
branches or cherry clusters (but never both). The cherry tree
contains no more than 1,000,000 branches.

All cherries growing on a single branch have the same time interval
in which they can be picked; Bessie must reap them during this
interval.

Cuts can be performed on any branch, close to its base. When a cut
is performed, all cherries growing on the corresponding branch along
with those growing on any branches connected directly or indirectly
to it are harvested. Bessie can make an arbitrary number of cuts a
single time unit.

What is the minimum number of cuts required to pick all berries?

Consider this cherry tree (note the tree's unusual branches that
grow both down and up!):

             [3,5]     /
              /       /   [6,9]
          \  /       /\    /
           \/  |    /  \  /
            \  |   /\   \/
             \ |  /  \   \
          ---&gt;\| /    \
               |/&lt;---  \
               |       [8,10]
               |

The bracketed numbers represent a cherry cluster and the time
interval during which it must be harvested; thus, this tree has
three cherry clusters. The arrows represent the locations of the
two optimal cuts which suffce to harvest the cherries. Making the
left cut at time 5 and the right one at time 8 will bring all the
cherries down at the peak of the flavorful perfection.

The first and only line of the standard input describes the cherry
tree recursively. The first integer denotes the number of branches
growing on the first branch (trunk); a description of each of those
branches follows.

Consider the input description for the tree above, which is shown
annotated below the input line:

      2 1 0 3 5 2 0 8 10 1 0 6 9
      | | | | | | | |  | | | | |
      | | | | | | | |  | | [g] Cherry cluster; harvest 6..9
      | | | | | | | |  | [f] One branch on this branch
      | | | | | | [e] Cherry cluster; harvest interval is 8..10
      | | | | | [d] Two branches on this branch
      | | [c] Cherry cluster on this branch; harvest interval is 3..5 
      | [b] One branch on this branch 
      [a] Two branches on this branch, the trunk 

             [3,5]     /
              /&lt;[c]   /   [6,9]
          \  /       /\&lt;[f]/
           \/  |    /  \  /&lt;[g]
            \  |   /\   \/
             \ |  /  \   \
          [b]&gt;\| /    \
               |/&lt;[d]  \&lt;[e]
               |       [8,10]

Problem 2: An Island Stroll [POI, 2009]

Farmer John expanded his farm and has acquired an entire island for
farming. The island is rimmed by a convex polygon with N (3 &lt;= N
&lt;= 100,000) vertices, each sporting a pasture nearby at coordinate
X_i,Y_i (-1,000,000 &lt;= X_i &lt;= 1,000,000; -1,000,000 &lt;= Y_i &lt;=
1,000,000). FJ has numbered the vertices conveniently in clockwise
order, 1..N.

Each pasture contains a straight-line path between it and every
other pasture. When two paths cross, there is an intersection and
one has the option of moving from one path to the other.

Farmer John would like to take a leisurely stroll from pasture 1
to pasture N, a task that is assuredly possible for all the given
input data.

Evil Farmer Don, however, has completely poisoned R (1 &lt;= R &lt;=
1,000,000) of the paths between pairs of pastures; the input data
describes the poisoned paths by naming their (differing) endpoints
P1_j and P2_j (1 &lt;= P1_j &lt;= N; 1 &lt;= P2_j &lt;= N). Please help Farmer
John find the shortest route from pasture 1 to pasture N that avoids
the traps on these paths (it is okay to cross these paths at an
intersection).  The list of traps contains no duplicates.

Consider a set of pastures on the corners of a square whose vertices
are (1,0), (1,-1), (0,-1), and (0,0).  The path that connects pasture
1 to pasture 2 is poisoned as is the path from pasture 4 to pasture
1:
                  4ppp1
                  |\ /p
                  | x p
                  |/ \p
                  3---2

To travers from 1 to 4 and avoid the poisoned paths, take the path
from pasture 1 towards pasture 3. When it intersects with the path
from pasture 2 to pasture 4, switch over to the 2-4 path and take
that path back to pasture 4. The total distance is sqrt(2)/2+sqrt(2)/2
= sqrt(2).

TIME LIMIT: 4 seconds

PROBLEM NAME: cisland

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and R

* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 describes vertex i with two space-separated
        integers: X_i and Y_i

* Lines N+2..N+R+1: Line j+N+1 describes path j poisoned by evil
        Farmer Don: P1_j and P2_j

SAMPLE INPUT (file cisland.in):

4 2
1 0
1 -1
0 -1
0 0
2 1
1 4

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single line with a single floating point number that is
        the length of the shortest safe route leading from pasture 1
        to pasture N. The absolute difference between the number
        returned and the correct one must be at most 1.0e-5.

Problem 3: Pareto's Domination [AUPC 2008 Problem E, 2010]

FJ wants to improve the management of his farm and has enrolled in
a microeconomics class at the Manure Institute of Technology.

In one of his classes, he learned about 'Pareto domination' (which
is apparently important for game theory). Pareto-domination has to
do with a relation between two M-dimensional points x_i = (x_i1,
x_i2, ..., xi_M) and x_j = (y_j1, y_j2, ..., y_jM) where (2 &lt;= M
&lt;= 4; 0 &lt;= x_ik &lt;= 1,000,000,000).

FJ recalls that a point x_i Pareto-dominates a point x_j if, for
each k (1 &lt;= k &lt;= M), the inequality x_ik &gt;= x_jk holds.

FJ must complete a problem set on Pareto-domination. For each
problem, he is given a set of N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 50,000) distinct points.
He must identify all points that are not Pareto-dominated by any
other points in the set.

Help FJ check his answer by writing a program to output the number
of points that are not Pareto-dominated by any other point.

TIME LIMIT: 1.5 seconds

MEMORY LIMIT: 64MB

PARTIAL CREDIT: For the real test data 2 out of 11 test cases have M = 2, 
3 out of 11 have M = 3 and the remaining 6 out of 11 have M = 4.

PROBLEM NAME: domination

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space separated integers: N and M

* Lines 2..N+1: Line i contains M space-separated integers: point x_i

SAMPLE INPUT (file domination.in):

4 2
0 0
1 1
2 0
0 2

INPUT DETAILS:

There are 4 points in 2D: (0,0), (1,1), (2,0), (0,2).

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer: the number of points that are not
        Pareto-dominated by any other point

SAMPLE OUTPUT (file domination.out):

3

OUTPUT DETAILS:

Only the point (0,0) is dominated.
